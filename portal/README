For all your installation needs, bring up the ALP installer, located at install/install.php

If you're upgrading from a previous version of ALP, bring up the ALP upgrader, located at install/upgrade.php

For any other help needs, we recommended going to our help website located at:
	http://www.nerdclub.net/alp/help.php

Notes:
-We recommend that you give _config.php write permissions before running the installer.
-If you wish to have your attendees be able to upload files, give write permissions to /files and all sub-directories
-If you wish to have your attendees be able to upload music, give write permissions to /music/mp3s
-If you are allowing your attendees to upload music or files, please make sure to edit your php.ini and change upload_max_filesize to at least 16M
-If you want map thumbnails on game server listings, please download the thumbnail pack and place it into alp.

System Requirements:
PHP 4.3.0+
MySQL 4.0+ - If you use MySQL 3.x you will get errors in any schedule pages, you will need to disable the schdule.

Even if your ALP install concludes successfully and without error, I'd still recommend reading the documentation
file entitled 'Using ALP at your LAN Party.'  It will help you get the most out of ALP.  It's also located at the 
help file.
