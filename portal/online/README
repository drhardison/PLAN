NOTE: This stuff is in beta form...I have tested it on my system and it should work ok for you!
However, there may be a few things I havn't thought of, or things that need fixing. 
If you find any of these please post them on the fourms at  www.nerdclub.net/alp   THX!!!

This is the first release of the Online addon for ALP. 
If you have any questions please visit www.nerdclub.net/alp and read the documentation and search the forums.
After searching through the forums if you still have questions feel free to post your question there.

Notes: 
1. sendmail requires the mail function to be enabled.
2. Paypal functionality requires you to enable IPN. 
		To do this login to paypal and go to profile
		Select Instant Payment notification from Seller Tools
		Enable it and put the link as http://FULL LINK TO THIS DIR/notify.php
		This will auto send e-mails to you and update their payment status



Installation:
1. Copy the contents of the "online" folder inside the ALP to your web server where you want the online scripts to be run.
2. Run the install.php page to create the tables and to create the admin account. When you run this it will generate a config file for you...please make sure you have permissions to do this!
	2a. Each time you update the settings you will have to choose a new (or re-type) admin password. This is due to one-way encryption. Maybe we'll fix later ;)
3. DELETE INSTALL.PHP!!! If you do not your database could be deleted or compromised.

Usage:
With this utility you are able to:
